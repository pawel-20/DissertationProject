This is a part of my dissertation, a website with a login/registration system. Once a user has registered and then logged in, he/she will be able to manipulate the brightness, saturation and contrast of the two images shown on the homepage.

The back-end was cerated with PHP and MySQLi. For the website to work it has to be hosted on a local server. Database name = "login", table name = "users", columns name are as followed = idUsers | uidUsers | emailUsers | pwdUsers.
